## Use a Web Host With PHP Support
If your server has activated support for PHP you do not need to do anything.

Just create some `.php` files, place them in your web directory, and the server will automatically parse them for you.
You do not need to compile anything or install any extra tools.
Because PHP is free, most web hosts offer PHP support.


## Set Up PHP on Your Own PC
However, if your server does not support PHP, you must:

-   install a web server
-   install PHP
-   install a database, such as MySQL

The official PHP website (PHP.net) has installation instructions for PHP: [http://php.net/manual/en/install.php](http://php.net/manual/en/install.php)
